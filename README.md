`moderate metadata moment`

anything i do on this site shouldn't be taken seriously, this is just where i upload projects i care enough about to somewhat maintain. if for whatever reason u want to flex on my shit code by contributing, feel free to. most if not all projects uploaded are not fully polished but still functional unless archived and you shouldn't trust an idiot (me) with running code on your system before auditing it yourself. for any adversaries feel free to backdoor my code through the github pipeline and pop a rootkit on my system.

**i am a professional recluse cause terminally online people suck and so do i, therefore i will probably not add or talk to you offsite.**
